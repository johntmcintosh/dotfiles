# Dotfiles

This is my personal collection of dotfiles for my typical setup. Feel free to browse/copy/fork, with the caveat that this is my personal setup and has not been tested elsewhere. 

I'm currently using [dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot) for managing the symlinks between this repo and my user directory as described in [managing your dotfiles](http://www.anishathalye.com/2014/08/03/managing-your-dotfiles/).
